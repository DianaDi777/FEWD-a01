 (FEWD assignment 1)
## My name is Dina
 
In the spring of 2018, I permanently moved to the US from Eastern Europe. 

Here in California, I'm transitioned from being a lawyer in another country to a Digital Media Specialist. Education-wise, I have a master’s degree in Law by the Russian Academy of Law and a degree in International Relations by the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain, along with 10 years of experience in these fields. Thanks to the legal background my strengths are critical thinking as well as strong logical and analytical abilities.

I was always interested in design. In order to gain more knowledge about graphic design, I participated in the 9-months-long Interactive Media Certificate Program by San Diego Continuing Education (SDCE). From April through July 2019, I was employed part-time as an assistant of Lorena Delgado, founder of Chic to Wear. I helped this brand with digital marketing and visual representations. It was a great experience for me to work with that fashion industry start-up. From May to September 2019, I participated in the mentorship program at Flashpoint Marketing Company as part of the team launching a new product Festival Flow Kit and creating  graphics such as logos, lables and social media posts.

My next professional experience related to graphic design and branding was working with Kiwi Spa. Organic Facial Innovation and managing their Social Media, creating graphics, and making Google Ads and Facebook Ads campaign.

Additionally, in 2018 I gained certificates in Project Management and Small Business Planning. It significantly increased my knowledge of how to deal with projects of all kinds and abilities to work with small business clients.
